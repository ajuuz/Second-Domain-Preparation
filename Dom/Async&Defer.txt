HTML parsing

- HTML document is parsed in a way that it starts from top and ends in the bottom 
- Top to bottom approach
- So its good to place the style above the document and script files below the document. 
- since script can block the loading of html.

- So if you are placing the script above . there is a chance of blockage. 
- To solve the issue use async or defer.


Async :-
<script src="script.js" async></script>
- continues html parsing while downloading script
- Extecutes soon after it is downloaded

Defer :-
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
- continues html parsing while downloading the script
- runs only after html fully parsed.
